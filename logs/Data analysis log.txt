	What is going on with some projects like linux-ntfs? For instance in 
	october 2008 14 M lines of code are added or changed, which is more than
	its total LOC count of around 6M. 8M lines are deleted, meaning a growth of
	6M is to be expected. Yet the total LOC for november 2008 has only
	marginally grown and is still at 6M.
	
	The totals reported in the SizeFacts are running totals of the lines added
	or deleted in individual commits performed during a month. Perhaps the same
	lines of code were added and deleted a large number of times?
	In october 2008 the project had 5812 commits performed by 753 contributors,
	so this may be the case.
	
	Conclusion: subtracting LOC deleted from LOC added or changed does not
	result in a	growth number.
	
April 9, 2013:
	Growth is now calculated by subtracting the total LOC in the previous month
	from the current month. A growth factor is obtained by dividing the growth
	by the previous month's total LOC. Yearly growth factors are obtained by
	taking the product of the monthly growth factors in a year.
	 
	Preliminary results:
	  Median yearly loc growth factors:
		  2008 1.13
		  2009 1.09
		  2010 1.05
		  2011 1.03
		  2012 1.02
	 2003-2012 1.08
	
	Project age (in years) has a -0.43 correlation with the yearly growth factor.
	Not too strong, but very significant with N=21000 (about).
